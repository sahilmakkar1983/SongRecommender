# SongRecommender

BPM based approach for Song Recommender - git community has helped me lot to progress on this path. 

Under progress...

Usage with test:

Run following command:
python $HOME/SongRecommenderBPMBased.py -c test.csv -s $HOME/test/1/FUUH.mp3 --regenerateCSV true --mp3dir $HOME/Desktop/songs/test

Or just run :
python $HOME/SongRecommenderBPMBased.py

It would print help.
